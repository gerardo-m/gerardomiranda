This is something new, as I am just trying to learn
tmux and use it to improve my use of the terminal, I 
decided maybe I can start to learn a bit of neovim
and if everything goes well, someday I'll do the full
change.

For now I'll be using it to make little changes, like 
to my static sites in my home server. And to write
my journal in my personal website.

Other than that I just realized my journal has a mistake,
since the directories are named 2024 instead of 2025,
I might be a time traveler.
