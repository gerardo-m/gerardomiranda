Today I wanted to work a little on my site, so I decided to clean up the news
section. Adding a new dependency for generating an excerpt of the news and 
moving the content to a dialog.

Also using named slots to clean the Layout from the dialog contents. I have
to repeat this for the other sections in the index page.
