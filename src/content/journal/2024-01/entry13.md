These last days  I haven't been able to work in my personal projects
I think I said that in my latest entry. 

Today I will dedicate at least an hour to write a talk I will present
next Tuesday on my club. This presentation will serve as practice
before I give this talk into an actual Tech conference.

The talk is about the importance of communication in the tech world.
I am a bit stuck since the goal is to have a 20 min talk and right
now is barely 3 minutes long ):
