This was my first year trying Advent of code, and it was definitively a
great experience. I use it to learn Go and I got pretty comfortable with
the language.

I only had to look for help in the reddit community for days 21 and 24...
those who completed all puzzles will now why.

All my solutions are in this [[ repo ]](https://github.com/gerardo-m/adventofcode)
