I finished the docker installer for this project, fixed the problems
with the production build and everything should be working as intended.

The project is far from finished, but that's the idea. Building features
but having a usable software in the meantime. 

Here is the [[ repo ]](https://github.com/gerardo-m/mochapi) with
instructions for installation. Documentation will be coming soon, once
more features are added.
