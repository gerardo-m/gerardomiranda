For a while I was just using dvh as a default when I was trying to have
an element adjusted to the site's height, but didn't fully understand the
difference with the other vh values.

Finally understood what it means and use it to prevent the mobile 
version of my site to have hiccups in the animation. I think the full 
concept of this vh and vw value is better understood with mobile in mind.
