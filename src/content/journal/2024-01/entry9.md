Yesterday I finished the version 0.2.0 of Mochapi, and today I decided
to upgrade my desktop OS. I am aiming to upgrade all the way to ubuntu
24, but we will upgrade to ubuntu 22 and see how it goes.

In the end I was able to upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04, the only thing
that was not working was mysql. Everything works now.
