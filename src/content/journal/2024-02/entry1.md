Been trying to resume my work on the mochapi project, but I haven't 
been able to. Busy days, not much energy remaining at the end of
the day.

But, in the mean time I did configure pi-hole in my home server, it
was a fun exercise. And one of the quircks I don't quite understand
yet is how when you set a DNS entry with a domain with a single
word (no periods), when I try to reach it through the browser in 
Windows like http://mysite/ just doesn't work. I have to put
http://mysite./ which I really think is weird.
