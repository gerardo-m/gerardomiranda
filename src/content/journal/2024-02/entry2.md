Well yesterday was busy, I did work a little bit in my pihole
installation. Basically fixing weird errors in Ubuntu.

Today I started fixing the latest mochapi installer, which I 
messed up. And also started to work on a github action to 
deploy this site automatically using FTP in my hosting
platform.
