Yesterday I was looking again at window tiling managers
and remember when I tried to use them and failed. I think
the main problem was that since that was affecting my entire
experience even outside of work, it was kind of hard to
stick with it. So I thought maybe with the multiplexer is
going to be easier, since I will only use it for programming
and will be confined to the terminal.

So installed tmux and starting configuring it. Of course
instead of moving a lot configurations away from the 
default I decided to modify my keyboard layout instead
having a dedicated layer for all the tmux basic operations.

For now it is working, and I hope it will improve.
