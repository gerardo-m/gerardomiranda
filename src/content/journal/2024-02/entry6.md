Today I was looking at my starred repositories, and somehow
one of the first ones I ever starred caught my eye. It
was a ruby gem called Addressable, that is used to parse
URIs and provides functionality to use URI templates.

This is basically what I need for mochapi, instead of my
very rudimentary parser I've been using. Apart from that
it uses RFC specifications, so I don't have to reinvent the
wheel and just use a stardard way of doing URI templates.

It was just testing so, I hope to start the implementation
tomorrow.
