Finally finished first working version of Mochapi. A couple of things that I learnt,
turbo just added a prefetch feature that basically starts the action in the server
when you hover over an element in the page. I found it annoying so I disabled it for
now.

Another thing, forgot to disable the force ssl for the app. Without it, the app
in prod will fail silently. Well not silently but it will not throw any message.

Anyways, started the year with the project working so I'm happy.
