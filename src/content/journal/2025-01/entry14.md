Last few days I have been focused on writing my talk about the importance
of communication, it was kind of hard to finish it but it went well in
the end. My talk was well received in my club, even tho I think it can be
improved.

Today I would like to resume the clean up of the code in my site. And 
after I would like to try Pi-Hole. I'll give it a try in my home server.

In the end I didn't have time to explore Pi-Hole, but I did finish
cleaning up my site, and organize a lot of stuff, specially the Layout 
and index page that were very cluttered with stuff. The aspect didn't
change at all, but the code is much cleaner.
