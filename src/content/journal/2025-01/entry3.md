Today I started with the pagination, which basically requires load all the 
entries, sorted them, reverse them and sliced them in chunks of 10 entries.

While doing that I found out that... well actually I was reminded that
javascript doesn't behave well with numbers. Even with javascript it
didn't want to work.

Also added a snippet to VS Code to add these entries quicker.
