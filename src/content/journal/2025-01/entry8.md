Today I worked in Mochapi after a couple of day with no progress
because life. I am not happy with how the code looks, so I will 
clean it up tomorrow.

Why? because right now the app is really simple, and if with just 
these couple of features the code is getting out of control it will
became a nightmare really fast. It is not early optimization, just 
a clean up.
