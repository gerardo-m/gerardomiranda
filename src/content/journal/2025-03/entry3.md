Then again this weekend I found some time to work on Mochapi, 
this time I added the options to add and delete the responses
and fixed some stuff that was not working.

Next stuff is going to be fun I think, that is implementing 
the expression model as conditions for the different responses.
The challenge will be to handle all the different options for
the expression values. That's why I'm going to start with a
simple use case using just the path variables.
