Haven't write anything lately, been having trouble finding time
to focus on my projects. I need to find the time, organize my
time better, so I have more chunks of time to put some deep
work.

Today I am finishing the next minor version for mochapi.
Officially making the tool usable for the first use case. Right
now we have to test and fix some of the appearance.
