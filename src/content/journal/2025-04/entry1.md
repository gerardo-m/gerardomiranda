Well it finally happened, I installed an AI assisted code 
editor, the obvious choice, Cursor. I didn't have any big
expectations, just wanted to build something quickly
without having to worry about little implementation details.

I went out of my way to start a new little project with 
Astro, using a simple strategy, going little by little
giving precise instructions. At the end of the day I got 
something working, not complete but working. And working
very well, I have to say it surpassed my expectations.

You see, I have used Copilot when it was in beta, the 
autocompletion was ok, but too invasive and of course
with not common languages it didn't work so well.

After that I left AI assistance for a while, until I 
tried Supermaven. It was much better, but at that point
I realized it wasn't that life changing.

Cursor is a huge leap, there were some details I didn't
write and it figure it out, which was nice. Nothing like
very deep, but the kind of stuff you often forgot when 
programming. That said of course there were things that
didn't work. Like sometimes it change names of variables
without reason, just because the context became too wide.
Or sometimes it ignores little differences between tools,
and frameworks.

I have extended too much in this. I just wanted to say,
I think I'm sold in regards of Cursor as a tool, I'll 
try to reach its limits and take maximum advantage of 
it.
