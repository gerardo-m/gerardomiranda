I am making a minigame for my girlfriend's birthday.
It is a very simple game and the challenge I imposed 
into myself was not only to use exclusively html, css
and javascript with no dependencies, but also I can't
use canvas for the animations, meaning all the game 
works with html elements.

No AI is allowed since this is an exercise, is not
something I just want generated.
