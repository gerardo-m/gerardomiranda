Just tried to use cursor IDE to generate most of my
unit tests for an ongoing project. Turns out it is
pretty useful, because tests are known to be very
verbose and repetitive.

Obviously there were some things that didn't know
how to do and did make silly mistakes. It did
save me a lot of time, that I would have had to 
invest into mundane test, now I just had to 
fix and write more specific tests and edge cases.
