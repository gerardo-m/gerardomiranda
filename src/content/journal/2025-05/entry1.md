Not sure how many times I'm leaving and returning to this project,
truth is I don't know why I can't commit to finish some stuff.

This time is to polish a feature that I'm needing for work, maybe
that is the push I need. A deadline, even tho this is not really a
deadline, more of, I really need this feature to use it on my job 
for real, so the sooner the better.

And as always when I return there is a lot of stuff that I forgot
but also I learn better how some stuff works. I hope to finish my 
project I planned for this year, including mochapi being in a 
good form.
