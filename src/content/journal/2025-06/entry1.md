Yesterday I tagged and release mochapi v0.4.0 I think this is the
first verision that feels complete, no weird bugs for the moment 
and everything feels smooth.

Today I just deployed it to use it at my job and then another
case that is not currently solvable showed up. So I will spend
some times the next days working on that.

Overall the project is going good.
